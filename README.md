# smart-scheduler
## If you are very busy with your stuff or you just want some freetime you should talk</br></br>Otherwise try to arrange meeting and contribute progress with your own initiative instead of waiting for arrangement.</br></br>   We have a very tight schedule, Feb has a progress report so by the end of Jan we need to setup a working app, working backend & database.</br></br>
