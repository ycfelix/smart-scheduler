# smart-scheduler
## I can actually do everything by myself.</br> If you are very busy with your stuff or you want some freetime and don't wanna do FYP then we can talk to Kenneth and split.</br></br>   Otherwise try to arrange meeting and contribute progress with your own initiative instead of waiting for arrangement.</br></br>   We have a very tight schedule, Feb has a progress report so by the end of Jan we need to setup a working app, working backend & database.</br></br>
